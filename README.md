ring.middleware.logger
======================

Ring middleware to log the duration and other details of each request.

The logging backend is pluggable, and defaults to clojure.tools.logging
if none is given.

This is ALPHA software; the internals and API can change at any time.
Pull requests are welcome!

Usage
-----

In your `project.clj`, add the following dependency:

```clojure
    [ring.middleware.logger "0.5.0"]
```


Then, just add the middleware to your stack. It comes preconfigured with
reasonable defaults, which append ANSI colorized log messages on each
request to whatever logger is in use by clojure.tools.logging.

```clojure
    (ns foo
      (:require [ring.adapter.jetty     :as jetty]
                [ring.middleware.logger :as logger]))

    (defn my-ring-app [request]
         {:status 200
          :headers {"Content-Type" "text/html"}
          :body "Hello world!"})

    (jetty/run-jetty (logger/wrap-with-logger my-ring-app) {:port 8080})
```


If you'd prefer plaintext logging without the ANSI colors, use
`wrap-with-plaintext-logger` instead.


Custom Logger Backend
-----------------------

You can supply custom logger functions to `wrap-with-logger` by supplying pairs
of `:level custom-logger-fn` as additional arguments.  These will be used
instead of the default `clojure.tools.logging` functions. The default mapping
is:

```clojure
      :info  (fn [x] (clojure.tools.logging/info x))
      :debug (fn [x] (clojure.tools.logging/debug x))
      :error (fn [x] (clojure.tools.logging/error x))
      :warn  (fn [x] (clojure.tools.logging/warn x))
```

Replace these functions with whatever logging facility you'd like to use. Each
function should take a string and log it at that log level.  For example, if
you want to use a different function to log info and debug messages, you could
call `wrap-with-logger` like this:

```clojure
      (wrap-with-logger my-ring-app
        :info (fn [x] (my.custom.logging/info x))
        :debug (fn [x] (my.custom.logging/â„¢debug x)))
```


What Gets Logged
----------------

The default setup logs:

* an :info-level message when a request begins;
* an :info level message when a response is generated without any server
errors (i.e. its HTTP status is < 500);
* an :error level message when a response's HTTP status is >= 500;
* an :error level message with a stack trace when an exception is thrown during response generation.

All messages are timestamped. Each request is assigned a random
4-hex-digit ID, so that different log messages pertaining to the same
request can be cross-referenced. These IDs are printed in random ANSI colors
by default, for easy visual correlation of log messages while reading
a log file.

Ignore URI's
------------

You can specify an optional list of uri that the logger should ignore. This can ideally
be used to ignore service healthz checks, favicon.io requests etc. Here is a sample
ignore-uris config:

```clojure
   (wrap-with-logger my-ring-app
     ; leading "/" are optional
     :ignore-uris ["/healthz" "favicon" "statz"])
```
