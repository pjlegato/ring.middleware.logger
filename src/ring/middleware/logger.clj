The convenience function (wrap-with-logger) calls this function with
default loggers. Use (make-logger) directly if you want to supply your own
logger functions.

Each request is assigned a random hex id, to allow the 3 possible
logging events to be correlated.

The pre-logger function is called before the handler is invoked, and
receives the id and the request as an argument.

The post-logger function is called after the response is generated,
and receives four arguments: the id, the request, the response, and the
total time taken by the handler.

The exception-logger function is called in a (catch) clause, if an
exception is thrown during the handler's run. It receives four
arguments: the id, the request, the Throwable that was thrown, and the
total time taken to that point. It re-throws the exception after
logging it, so that other middleware has a chance to do something with
it.
