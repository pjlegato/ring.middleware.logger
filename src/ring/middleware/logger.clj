  "Adds logging for requests using the given logger functions.

  The convenience function (wrap-with-logger) calls this function with
  default loggers. Use (make-logger) directly if you want to supply your own
  logger functions.

  Each request is assigned a random hex id, to allow logged events
  relevant to a particular request to be correlated. This is exposed as
  a log4j Nested Diagnostic Context (NDC). Add a %x to your log format
  string to log it. (OneLog already includes the necessary %x by
  default.)

  The pre-logger function is called before the handler is invoked, and
  receives the request as an argument.

  The post-logger function is called after the response is generated,
  and receives the request, the response, and the total time taken by the handler as arguments

  The exception-logger function is called in a (catch) clause, if an
  exception is thrown during the handler's run. It receives the request,
  the Throwable that was thrown, and the total time taken to that
  point. It re-throws the exception after logging it, so that other
  middleware has a chance to do something with it.

  The ignore-uris list represents a list of uri's to which requests do not need to be
  logged . This can typically by used for service healthz and statz endpoints
