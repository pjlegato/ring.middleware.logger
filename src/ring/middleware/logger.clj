  "Adds logging for requests using the given logger functions.

The convenience function (wrap-with-logger) calls this function with
default loggers. Use (make-logger) directly if you want to supply your own
logger functions.

Each request is assigned a random hex id, to allow logged events
relevant to a particular request to be correlated. This is exposed as
a log4j Nested Diagnostic Context (NDC). Add a %x to your log format
string to log it. (OneLog already includes the necessary %x by
default.)

The pre-logger function is called before the handler is invoked, and
receives the request as an argument.

The post-logger function is called after the response is generated,
and receives the request, the response, and the total time taken by the handler as arguments

The exception-logger function is called in a (catch) clause, if an
exception is thrown during the handler's run. It receives the request,
the Throwable that was thrown, and the total time taken to that
point. It re-throws the exception after logging it, so that other
middleware has a chance to do something with it.
